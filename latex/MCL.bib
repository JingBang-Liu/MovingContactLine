	abstract = {Hypothesis
The thermal fluctuations of the three-phase contact line formed between a liquid and a solid at equilibrium can be used to determine key parameters that control dynamic wetting.
Methods
We use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and Lennard-Jones potentials to model a liquid bridge between two molecularly smooth solid surfaces and study the positional fluctuations of the contact lines so formed as a function of the solid–liquid interaction.
Findings
We show that the fluctuations have a Gaussian distribution and may be modelled as an overdamped one-dimensional Langevin oscillator. Our analysis allows us to extract the coefficients of friction per unit length of the contact lines ζ, which arise from the collective interaction of the contact-line’s constituent liquid atoms with each other and the solid surface. We then compare these coefficients with those obtained by measuring the dynamic contact angle as a function of contact-line speed in independent simulations and applying the molecular-kinetic theory of dynamic wetting. We find excellent agreement between the two, with the same dependence on solid–liquid interaction and, therefore, the equilibrium contact angle θ0. As well as providing further evidence for the underlying validity of the molecular-kinetic model, our results suggest that it should be possible to predict the dynamics of wetting and, in particular, the velocity-dependence of the local, microscopic dynamic contact angle, by experimentally measuring the fluctuations of the contact line of a capillary system at equilibrium. This would circumvent the need to measure the microscopic dynamic contact angle directly.},

	abstract = {Wetting is a prerequisite for coating a uniform layer of liquid onto a solid. Wetting failure and air entrainment set the ultimate limit to coating speed. It is well known in the coating art that this limit can be postponed by manipulating the coating flow to generate what has been termed “hydrodynamic assist,” but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Experiments have shown that the conditions that postpone air entrainment also reduce the apparent dynamic contact angle, suggesting a direct link, but how the flow might affect the contact angle remains to be established. Here, we use molecular dynamics to compare the outcome of steady forced wetting with previous results for the spontaneous spreading of liquid drops and apply the molecular-kinetic theory of dynamic wetting to rationalize our findings and place them on a quantitative footing. The forced wetting simulations reveal significant slip at the solid-liquid interface and details of the flow immediately adjacent to the moving contact line. Our results confirm that the local, microscopic contact angle is dependent not simply only on the velocity of wetting but also on the nature of the flow that drives it. In particular, they support an earlier suggestion that during forced wetting, an intense shear stress in the vicinity of the contact line can assist surface tension forces in promoting dynamic wetting, thus reducing the velocity-dependence of the contact angle. Hydrodynamic assist then appears as a natural consequence of wetting that emerges when the contact line is driven by a strong and highly confined flow. Our theoretical approach also provides a self-consistent model of molecular slip at the solid-liquid interface that enables its magnitude to be estimated from dynamic contact angle measurements. In addition, the model predicts how hydrodynamic assist and slip may be influenced by liquid viscosity and solid-liquid interactions.},

A linear stability analysis of the STF allows us to derive a power spectrum for the surface fluctuations, which is quantitatively validated against the spectrum observed in MD. Thermal fluctuations are shown to be critical to the dynamics of nanoscale films. Compared to the classical instability mechanism, which is driven by disjoining pressure, fluctuations (a) can massively amplify the instability, (b) cause the fluctuation wavelength that is dominant to evolve in time (a single fastest-growing mode does not exist), and (c) decrease the critical wavelength so that classically stable films can be ruptured.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

The behaviour of the macroscopic contact angle varies linearly over a range of capillary numbers beyond which the liquid bridge pinches off, a behaviour supported by experimental results. Nonetheless, the liquid bridge provides an ideal test case to study molecular scale thermal fluctuations, which are shown to be well described by Gaussian distributions. A Langevin model for contact angle is parametrised to incorporate the mean, fluctuation and auto-correlations over a range of sliding speeds and temperatures.

That the behavior of sliding drops at the nanoscale mirrors that seen in macroscopic experiments, that the local microscopic contact angle is velocity dependent in a way that is consistent with the molecular-kinetic theory (MKT), and that observations at this scale shed light on the pearling transition seen with larger drops.
Methods
We use large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) to model a nanodrop of liquid sliding across a solid surface under the influence of an external force. The simulations enable us to extract the shape of the drop, details of flow within the drop and the local dynamic contact angle at all points around its periphery.
Findings
Our results confirm the macroscopic observation that the dynamic contact angle at all points around the drop is a function of the velocity of the contact line normal to itself, Ucmsinϕ, where Ucm is the velocity of the drop’s center of mass and ϕ is the slope of the contact line with respect to the direction of travel. Flow within the drop agrees with that observed on the surface of macroscopic drops. If slip between the first layer of liquid molecules and the solid surface is accounted for, the velocity-dependence of the dynamic contact angle is identical with that found previous MD simulations of spreading drops, and consistent with the MKT. If the external force is increased beyond a certain point, the drop elongates and a neck appears between the front and rear of the drop, which separate into two distinct zones. This appears to be the onset of the pearling transition at the tip of a macroscopic drop. The receding contact angle at the tip of the drop is far removed from its equilibrium value but non-zero and approaches a more-or-less constant critical value as the transition progresses.},

	abstract = {It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean.},

	abstract = {A general mathematical model which describes the motion of an
interface between immiscible viscous fluids along a smooth homogeneous
solid
surface is examined in the case of small capillary and Reynolds numbers.
The
model stems from a conclusion that the Young equation,
σ1 cos θ = σ2 − σ3,
which expresses the balance of tangential projection of the forces acting
on the
three-phase contact line in terms of the surface tensions
σi and the contact angle θ, together with
the
well-established experimental
fact that the dynamic contact angle deviates from the static one, imply
that
the surface tensions of contacting interfaces in the immediate vicinity
of the
contact line deviate
from their equilibrium values when the contact line is moving. The same
conclusion
also follows from the experimentally observed kinematics of the flow, which
indicates that liquid particles belonging to interfaces traverse the three-phase
interaction zone
(i.e. the ‘contact line’) in a finite time and become elements
of
another interface – hence their surface properties have to relax
to new
equilibrium values giving rise to
the surface tension gradients in the neighbourhood of the moving contact
line. The
kinematic picture of the flow also suggests that the contact-line motion
is only a
particular case of a more general phenomenon – the process of interface
formation or disappearance – and the corresponding mathematical model
should
be derived from first principles for this general process and then applied
to
wetting as well as to other relevant flows. In the present paper, the simplest
theory which uses this approach is formulated and applied to the moving
contact-line problem. The model describes the true kinematics of the flow
so that
it allows for the ‘splitting’ of the
free surface at the contact line, the appearance of the surface tension
gradients
near the contact line and their influence upon the contact angle and the
flow field. An analytical expression for the dependence of the dynamic
contact
angle on the contact-line speed and parameters characterizing properties
of
contacting media is derived and examined. The role of a ‘thin’
microscopic residual film formed by adsorbed
molecules of the receding fluid is considered. The flow field in the vicinity
of the contact line is analysed. The results are compared with experimental
data obtained for different fluid/liquid/solid systems.},

Two levels of solid−liquid interaction are considered that give rise to large equilibrium contact angles. The initial length and thickness of the films are varied over a wide range at the nanoscale. Spontaneous dewetting is initiated by removing a band of molecules either from each end of the film or from its center. As observed experimentally and in previous simulations, the films recede at an initially constant speed, creating a growing rim of liquid with a constant receding dynamic contact angle. Consistent with the current understanding of wetting dynamics, film recession is faster on the more poorly wetted surface to an extent that cannot be explained solely by the increase in the surface tension driving force. In addition, the rates of recession of the thinnest films are found to increase with decreasing film thickness. These new results imply not only that the mobility of the liquid molecules adjacent to the solid increases with decreasing solid−liquid interactions, but also that the mobility adjacent to the free surface of the film is higher than in the bulk, so that the effective viscosity of the film decreases with thickness.},

The results for these systems are shown to be consistent with the molecular-kinetic theory (MKT) of dynamic wetting, which emphasizes the role of contact-line friction as the principal channel of energy dissipation. Several predictions have been confirmed. These include a quantitative link between the dynamics of wetting and the work of adhesion and the existence of an optimum equilibrium contact angle that maximizes the speed of wetting. A feature of the new work is that key parameters (κ0 and λ), normally accessible only by fitting the MKT to dynamic contact angle data, are also obtained directly from the simulations, with good agreement between the two sources. This validates the MKT at some fundamental level. Further verification is provided by contact angle relaxation studies, which also lend support to the interfacial tension relaxation process invoked in Shikhmurzaev’s hydrodynamic model of dynamic wetting.},

	abstract = {The study of the dynamics of fluids is a central theme of modern applied mathematics. It is used to model a vast range of physical phenomena and plays a vital role in science and engineering. This textbook provides a clear introduction to both the theory and application of fluid dynamics, and will be suitable for all undergraduates coming to the subject for the first time. Prerequisites are few: a basic knowledge of vector calculus, complex analysis, and simple methods for solving differential equations are all that is needed. Throughout, numerous exercises (with hints and answers) illustrate the main ideas and serve to consolidate the reader's understanding of the subject. The book's wide scope (including inviscid and viscous flows, waves in fluids, boundary layer flow, and instability in flow) and frequent references to experiments and the history of the subject, ensures that this book provides a comprehensive and absorbing introduction to the mathematical study of fluid behaviour.},
